1. event binding starts with ()
2. Property / attribute binding starts with []
3. Two way binding is one with both combination for eg: [(ngModel)] = "property name you want to connect".
4. When you send data from parent to child, we use @Input for parameters
5. when you send data from child to parent, we use @Output for sending any params or return value.
